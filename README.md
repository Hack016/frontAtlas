# frontAtlas
In this repository I will try to create my own mobile app using Django as backend and Expo and React native as Front-end. It will be a training app for the gym in which you would be able to register your own exercises and see your progress with graphics thanks to the stadistics recopilated. This is the code of the frontend part (React Native)
